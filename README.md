[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/aklt/rel.vim.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/aklt/rel.vim)

This is a Vim plugin for following and defining links to other files. 
You can define which programs to use to open files according to 
the file suffix.  It is also possible to define custom schemes for 
opening files. 

This script requires at least Vim v8.0.0020 or Neovim v0.2.0.

## The name

REL stands for Resource Locator and sounds almost like URL if said quickly.
